We took our trousers off, the socialists asleep. We talked and talked for hours, it was really deep.You're a kind of angel, dancing by the table.I was doing fine then I met you. I don't need a sign, what will be will be.Let's go start a life somewhere in the weeds.I am usually able, but your effect is fatal.I was doing fine then I met you. I was doing fine but then I met you.My feet are aching
And your back is pretty tired
And we've drunk a couple bottles, babe
And set our grief aside
The papers say it's doomsday
The button has been pressed
We're gonna nuke each other up, boys
'Til old Satan stands impressed
And here it is, our final night alive
And as the earth burns to the ground
Oh, girl, it's you that I lie with
As the atom bomb locks in
Oh, it's you I watch TV with
As the world, as the world caves in
You put your finest suit on
I paint my fingernails
Oh, we're going out in style, babe
And everything's on sale
We creep up on extinction
I pull your arms right in
I weep and say "Goodnight, love"
While my organs pack it in
And here it is, our final night alive
And as the earth burns to the ground
Oh, girl, it's you that I lie with
As the atom bomb locks in
Oh, it's you I watch TV with
As the world, as the world caves—
Oh, it's you that I lie with
As the atom bomb locks in
Yes, it's you I welcome death with
As the world, as the world caves in
As the world caves in
I was growing younger day by day
There was love and it was all the rage
And I held you with a wandering eye
Now I know the girl I shoulda known
Now I feel the love I should've shown
And I pull you in but you push me out
And I know you don't love me so
But please say it once before I go
I know that you can feel me
Tell me that you don't love me
But say it one more time
I'm going darling, I'll step lightly
Live on as if you still love me
Just say it one more time
Even if it's a lie, even if it's a lie
Colors in the dress you used to wear
The way that you'd put up your golden hair
But I'll turn the lights down and leave
All the ways that I could say it now
You're the girl to push away my doubt
But it's too late and we’re too young to know
And I know you don't love me so
But please say it once before I go
I know that you can feel me
Tell me that you don't love me
But say it one more time
I'm going darling, I'll step lightly
Live on as if you still love me
Just say it one more time
I know that she can feel me
Tell me that you don't love me
But say it one more time
I'm going darling, I'll step lightly
Live on as if you still love me
Just say it one more time
Even if it's a lie, even if it's a lie
Even if it's a lie, even if it's a lie
I'm just a little person
One person in a sea
Of many little people
Who are not aware of me
I do my little jobs
Live my little life
Eat my little meals
Miss my little kid and wife
And somewhere, maybe someday
Maybe somewhere far away
I’ll find a second little person
Who will look at me and say
"I know you, you're the one I've waited for
Let’s have some fun"
Life is precious, every minute
And more precious with you in it
So let's have some fun
We'll take a road trip way out west
You're the one I like the best
I'm glad I found you
I like hangin' 'round you
You're the one I like the best
Somewhere, maybe someday
Maybe somewhere far away
Somewhere, maybe someday
Maybe somewhere far away
Somewhere, maybe someday
Maybe somewhere far away
I’ll find a second little person
And we’ll go out and play
There was a time when I worshipped the ground you walked on
There was a time when I'd cut off my ear for you
There was a time when I worshipped the towel you dried on
There was a time when I'd kill all my friends for you
You're the only one
Makes me wanna cry
You're the only one
Makes me wanna beat up inside
You're the only one
Makes me feel alive
You're the only one
Makes me wanna go home and
Curl up and die
Curl up and die
There was a time
When there was only you and no one
There was a time
When I'd take any pity shag
You're the only one
Makes me wanna cry
You're the only one
Makes me wanna move to Versailles
You're the only one
Makes me feel alive
You're the only one
Makes me wanna go home and
Curl up and die
Curl up and die
Curl up and die
Curl up and die
Curl up and die
I was just the dirt on your shoe
(Curl up and die)
And I liked being that
(Curl up and die)
I was just the germs in your flu
(Curl up and die)
And I liked being that
(Ah)
I was just the chip on your tooth
And I liked being that
(Ah)
I was just the me to your you
And I liked being that
I'm just a little person
One person in a sea
Of many little people

I’ll find a second little person
And we’ll go out and play
The children going hungry
The footsies going old
A mother turns to drinking
And blacks out on a bus
And I guess no one won the war
It's only 9AM now but I already smell this town
The workers work for something
And there's pills for feeling down
And I guess no one won the war
The new day is now done
Did you hear another gun?
Some folks had their fun
There's an awful lot of blood
Let's go to the club now
And take another drug
It's kind of shit but the bass is loud
And I'm drowning by the sub
And I guess no one won the war
A man taught to trust money
And be skeptical of love
Money's his true mistress
While his wife is just a front
And I guess no one won the war

The new day is now done
Did you hear another gun?
Some folks had their fun
There's an awful lot of blood
All of them
Dreaming strange inventions in the shade
Thirty mile-an-hour domestic winds
Blow away my nice domestic things
The ground is full of improbable vegetations
Black and heavy branches cut the sky
Mechanisms work behind my eyes
What a mystery (Mystery)
That I could want you still
It's a mystery (Mystery)
That I would pick you ten out of nine times
The water's cold
All the red fish leave my feet alone
Crush of people walk along the street
The perfume they wear smells good to meAnd what a mystery (Mystery)
That I could want you still
It's a mystery (Mystery)
That I would pick you ten out of nine times
I remember when I would, stroke your hair
You turn and tell me, you had no other cares
But when we went and walked the inner streets
The joy the life we felt beneath our feet
But time changes
We turn pages
And everything we said, turns golden dead
But time changes
Fades old faces
She sleeps, in a new bed
Sure enough, you'll have a new man now
Something he can give
I find myself without
And I can eat all the, oranges and pears
But she ain't coming back she says
Simply ends
But time changes
we turn pages
And everything we said, turns golden dead
But time changes
Fades old faces
She sleeps, in a new bed
Well time changes
We turn pages
And everything we were
With someone else
But time changes
We build new spaces
And she sleeps
*Humming*
She sleeps, in a new bed
Now that we're doomed
Let me show you to your room
Where we can implode by the moon
I'm a self-obsessed mess
And you can't sleep for shit
And we're both gladly losing our minds
We sure have a strange time
But we sure do it right
We sure have a strange time
We're getting stranger every night
Tonight I'll be drunk
And act like a punk (so drunk)
And you'll sit and laugh while I throw up
They say I'm too old for my age
And you're just the same
Yet we make love like kids, again and again
We sure have a strange time
But we sure do it right
We sure have a strange time
We're getting stranger every night   
And I'm naked now, on your fine red couch and you
Put your body to me
You put your body to me
I'm naked now on your fine red couch and you
You can see right through me
Come on now, lets just have a strange time
Oh it's just right if we deface our minds
We can have a strange time
And get stranger every night
And get stranger every night
Home, home sweet home
Live, laugh, love
These are some things written by the phone
On the wall of this home
Located on nowhere avenue
Don’t understand how everyone lives inside their head   
Multi-colored ornaments in people’s houses make me feel like
No one out there understands me
Well, that’s half the battle baby
Continental condiments in peoples houses make me happy
Can't you tell me why I'm empty?
Welcome to the madhouse, baby
Memes, beauty dreams, self-help schemes
These are some things I can sit and read
Every dark, every tweet
Reckons with the different same old time
Confused in tide
While everyone powers on with life
Multi-colored ornaments in people’s houses make me feel like
No one out there understands me
Well, that’s half the battle baby

Can't you tell me why I'm empty?
Welcome to the madhouse, baby
Multi-colored ornaments in people’s houses make me feel like
I’m the only one who’s out here
Everybody feels like that kid
Continental condiments in people’s houses make me happy
Can’t you tell me why I’m empty?
Welcome to the madhouse, baby
Welcome to the madhouse, baby
I once believed in everything lasting forever
But sometimes it's not the time and it's alright to stop
Heaven knows why it never goes how we want it to
Oh, I wish I felt it for you
But I've got issues with everything and everyone
We need to talk
No, it's not your fault
I'm in the state I'm in
I'm out of love
Don't know where to start
But we need to talk
I know we've tried a thousand times to make it work out
And everything that we try to say has all been said
Heaven knows why it never goes how we want it to
But I'll always feel it for you
And I've got issues with everything and everyone
We need to talk
No, it's not your fault
I'm in the state I'm in
I'm out of love
Don't know where to start
But we need to talk
And if we say goodbye
It's gonna hurt you
It's gonna hurt me
And though it don't feel right
We try and push through like we're happy
Maybe down the line I'm gonna know you
But I won't
While I've got issues with everything and everyone
We need to talk
No, it's not your fault
I'm in the state I'm in
I'm out of love
Don't know where to start
But we need to talk
The red light of the evening
The cotton that you wear
They cover up your neck this way
Your calm and naked crying
Washing off Chanel
From the edges of your neck this way	
You did some things that you forgot
Drinking wine and smoking pot
You tried to be someone you are not
Now the morning sweeps you up
You take your evening outfit off
You run your shower and lean back your head
I love when you wash your hair
I hear you tell me lightly
You were quite a mess
But I worship you no less this way
You're quite the angel, Mary
As you cut up last night's dress
It lingers piece by piece this way
You did some things that you forgot
Drinking wine and smoking pot
You tried to be someone you are not
Now the morning sweeps you up
You take your evening outfit off
You run your bath and lean back your head
I love when you wash your hair
I love when you wash your hair
I see two lovers kiss on the street by Studio 6
And I remember the petrol-thick mist, we settled our lips
And I remember hearing your father laugh
While we made love in the next room, we made love in the next room
And I remember one of those mornings I, I reached out to wake you, but I learned that he'd taken you back.
I look through the glass to housing blocks and energy fans
I see slow familiar lovers, I see them pull their curtains back
And I remember pulling your curtains back, then we made love to the old moon, we made love to the old moon
And I remember one of those mornings I, I reached out to wake you, but I learned that he'd taken you back
And I remember you wearing that pink August coat
that my grandmother wore as my grandfather's love.
You're a little more clear with this wine in my hand
And it colours my tongue as if your lipstick has run
And I remember hearing your father laugh
While we made love in the next room, we made love in the next room. 
We took our trousers off, the socialists asleep. We talked and talked for hours, it was really deep.You're a kind of angel, dancing by the table.I was doing fine then I met you.

And your back is pretty tired
And we've drunk a couple bottles, babe
And set our grief aside
The papers say it's doomsday
The button has been pressed
We're gonna nuke each other up, boys
'Til old Satan stands impressed
And here it is, our final night alive
And as the earth burns to the ground
Oh, girl, it's you that I lie with
As the atom bomb locks in
Oh, it's you I watch TV with
As the world, as the world caves in
You put your finest suit on
I paint my fingernails
Oh, we're going out in style, babe
And everything's on sale
We creep up on extinction
I pull your arms right in
I weep and say "Goodnight, love"

Now the morning sweeps you up
You take your evening outfit off
You run your bath and lean back your head
I love when you wash your hair
I love when you wash your hair
I see two lovers kiss on the street by Studio 6
And I remember the petrol-thick mist, we settled our lips
And I remember hearing your father laugh
While we made love in the next room, we made love in the next room
And I remember one of those mornings I, I reached out to wake you, but I learned that he'd taken you back.
I look through the glass to housing blocks and energy fans
I see slow familiar lovers, I see them pull their curtains back
And I remember pulling your curtains back, then we made love to the old moon, we made love to the old moon
And I remember one of those mornings I, I reached out to wake you, but I learned that he'd taken you back
And I remember you wearing that pink August coat
that my grandmother wore as my grandfather's love.
You're a little more clear with this wine in my hand
And it colours my tongue as if your lipstick has run
And I remember hearing your father laugh
While we made love in the next room, we made love in the next room. We took our trousers off, the socialists asleep. We talked and talked for hours, it was really deep.You're a kind of angel, dancing by the table.I was doing fine then I met you. I don't need a sign, what will be will be.Let's go start a life somewhere in the weeds.I am usually able, but your effect is fatal.I was doing fine then I met you. I was doing fine but then I met you.My feet are aching
And your back is pretty tired
And we've drunk a couple bottles, babe
And set our grief aside
The papers say it's doomsday
The button has been pressed
We're gonna nuke each other up, boys
'Til old Satan stands impressed
And here it is, our final night alive
And as the earth burns to the ground
Oh, girl, it's you that I lie with
As the atom bomb locks in
Oh, it's you I watch TV with
As the world, as the world caves in
You put your finest suit on
I paint my fingernails
Oh, we're going out in style, babe
And everything's on sale
We creep up on extinction
I pull your arms right in
I weep and say "Goodnight, love"
While my organs pack it in
And here it is, our final night alive
And as the earth burns to the ground
Oh, girl, it's you that I lie with
As the atom bomb locks in
Oh, it's you I watch TV with
As the world, as the world caves—
Oh, it's you that I lie with
As the atom bomb locks in
Yes, it's you I welcome death with
As the world, as the world caves in
As the world caves in
I was growing younger day by day
There was love and it was all the rage
And I held you with a wandering eye
Now I know the girl I shoulda known
Now I feel the love I should've shown
And I pull you in but you push me out
And I know you don't love me so
But please say it once before I go
I know that you can feel me
Tell me that you don't love me
But say it one more time
I'm going darling, I'll step lightly
Live on as if you still love me
Just say it one more time
Even if it's a lie, even if it's a lie
Colors in the dress you used to wear
The way that you'd put up your golden hair
But I'll turn the lights down and leave
All the ways that I could say it now
You're the girl to push away my doubt
But it's too late and we’re too young to know
And I know you don't love me so
But please say it once before I go
I know that you can feel me
Tell me that you don't love me
But say it one more time
I'm going darling, I'll step lightly
Live on as if you still love me
Just say it one more time
I know that she can feel me
Tell me that you don't love me
But say it one more time
I'm going darling, I'll step lightly
Live on as if you still love me
Just say it one more time
Even if it's a lie, even if it's a lie
Even if it's a lie, even if it's a lie
I'm just a little person
One person in a sea
Of many little people
Who are not aware of me
I do my little jobs
Live my little life
Eat my little meals
Miss my little kid and wife
And somewhere, maybe someday
Maybe somewhere far away
I’ll find a second little person
Who will look at me and say
"I know you, you're the one I've waited for
Let’s have some fun"
Life is precious, every minute
And more precious with you in it
So let's have some fun
We'll take a road trip way out west
You're the one I like the best
I'm glad I found you
I like hangin' 'round you
You're the one I like the best
Somewhere, maybe someday
Maybe somewhere far away
Somewhere, maybe someday
Maybe somewhere far away
Somewhere, maybe someday
Maybe somewhere far away
I’ll find a second little person
And we’ll go out and play
There was a time when I worshipped the ground you walked on
There was a time when I'd cut off my ear for you
There was a time when I worshipped the towel you dried on
There was a time when I'd kill all my friends for you
You're the only one
Makes me wanna cry
You're the only one
Makes me wanna beat up inside
You're the only one
Makes me feel alive
You're the only one
Makes me wanna go home and
Curl up and die
Curl up and die
There was a time
When there was only you and no one
There was a time
When I'd take any pity shag
You're the only one
Makes me wanna cry
You're the only one
Makes me wanna move to Versailles
You're the only one
Makes me feel alive
You're the only one
Makes me wanna go home and
Curl up and die
Curl up and die
Curl up and die
Curl up and die
Curl up and die
I was just the dirt on your shoe
(Curl up and die)
And I liked being that
(Curl up and die)
I was just the germs in your flu
(Curl up and die)
And I liked being that
(Ah)
I was just the chip on your tooth
And I liked being that
(Ah)
I was just the me to your you
And I liked being that
I'm just a little person
One person in a sea
Of many little people
Who are not aware of me
I do my little jobs
Live my little life
Eat my little meals
Miss my little kid and wife
And somewhere, maybe someday
Maybe somewhere far away
I’ll find a second little person
Who will look at me and say
"I know you, you're the one I've waited for
Let’s have some fun"
Life is precious, every minute
And more precious with you in it
So let's have some fun
We'll take a road trip way out west
You're the one I like the best
I'm glad I found you
I like hangin' 'round you
